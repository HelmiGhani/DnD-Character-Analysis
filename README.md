# D&D Character Analysis

This is part of the Associate Data Analyst course by NTUC LearningHub. This project uses Microsoft Excel and Power Query for the cleaning of data and visualisation of the dashboard.

## Data

The data is from [Kaggle -> DnD Characters](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maximebonnin/dnd-characters-test) by Maxime Bonnin.

## Process

As a Dungeon Master (DM), I had always wondered what to expect from longer campaigns, especially being able to play at higher levels.
I found a dataset online with the list of characters on D&D Beyond and decided to do an analysis on the type of characters that people are using in their campaigns.
